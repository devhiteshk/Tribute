                    <h2>Early Life</h2>
                    Dwayne Douglas Johnson was born in Hayward, California on May 2, 1972, the son of Ata Johnson (née Maivia; born 1948) and former professional wrestler Rocky Johnson (born Wayde Douglas Bowles; 1944–2020). Growing up, Johnson lived briefly in Grey Lynn
                    in New Zealand with his mother's family, where he played rugby and attended Richmond Road Primary School before returning to the U.S. He then attended Montclaire Elementary School in Charlotte, North Carolina, before moving to Hamden,
                    Connecticut, where he spent a couple of years at Shepherd Glen Elementary School and Hamden Middle School. He spent his high school years at President William McKinley High School in Honolulu, Hawaii, then Glencliff High School and
                    McGavock High School in Nashville, Tennessee, and finally Freedom High School in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. He was arrested multiple times for fighting, theft, and check fraud before the age of 17. He was on his high schools' gridiron
                    football, track and field, and wrestling teams. Johnson's father was a Black Nova Scotian, with a small amount of Irish ancestry, while his mother is Samoan. His father was part of the first black tag team champions in WWE history
                    along with Tony Atlas. His mother is the adopted daughter of Peter Maivia, who was also a pro wrestler. Maivia's wife, Lia, was the first female pro wrestling promoter, taking over Polynesian Pacific Pro Wrestling after her husband's
                    death in 1982, until 1988. Through his grandfather Maivia, Johnson is considered a non-blood relative to the Anoa'i wrestling family. In 2008, Johnson inducted his father and grandfather into the WWE Hall of Fame.

                    <h2>Becoming "The Rock"</h2>
                    With few prospects in professional football, Johnson turned to wrestling, debuting in the WWF against the Brooklyn Brawler in Texas. After a couple more matches, including a tag team win with Bart Sawyer, the WWF signed him under the name Flex Kavana.
                    A year later, he joined The Nation of Domination, eventually taking over its leadership and calling himself The Rock. He later joined another band of elite wrestlers known as The Corporation and began a notorious feud with Steve Austin.
                    Also known as "The People's Champ," The Rock went on to win a combined 17 WWF/WWE titles over his acclaimed career.


                    <h2>Going Hollywood</h2>
                    The brash charm that Johnson exhibited in his in-ring monologues translated smoothly to the silver screen, and his appearance in The Mummy Returns (2001) signaled a new stage in his career. Although Johnson was neither the first nor the last professional
                    wrestler to be courted by Hollywood, he was easily the most successful. He followed “The Mummy Returns” with The Scorpion King (2002) and The Rundown (2003). <br><br> In 2004 he left the ring to turn his attention
                    to acting full-time. Johnson’s later films included testosterone-fueled action fare such as G.I. Joe: Retaliation (2013), Pain & Gain (2013), and four installments of The Fast and the Furious series—Fast Five (2011), Fast & Furious
                    6 (2013), Furious 7 (2015), and The Fate of the Furious (2017). <br><br> He also appeared in the family entertainments The Game Plan (2007), Tooth Fairy (2010), and Journey 2: The Mysterious Island (2012). Johnson then was cast as
                    the titular Greek mythological figure in Hercules (2014). He played a firefighter dealing with a catastrophic earthquake in the action film San Andreas (2015), and in 2016 he starred opposite comedian Kevin Hart in the buddy comedy
                    Central Intelligence. Johnson later provided the voice of a demigod in Moana (2016), an animated film by Disney. <br><br> In 2017 he starred in Baywatch, a comedy based on the TV series about lifeguards, and Jumanji: Welcome to the
                    Jungle, which was adapted from a children’s book by Chris Van Allsburg. The next year Johnson portrayed a father who goes to great heights to save his family from a burning building in the action movie Skyscraper. <br><br> He then
                    starred in Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw, a spin-off from the long-running franchise, and Jumanji: The Next Level (both 2019), a sequel to the 2017 film. Johnson appeared in various television projects. In 2013 he hosted the
                    reality television series The Hero, and he later starred in Ballers (2015–19), an HBO comedy series about a former football player who becomes a financial adviser to other sports stars. <br><br> Johnson then created and hosted the
                    reality TV series The Titan Games (2019– ), which featured a variety of athletic competitions. He later appeared in Young Rock (2021– ), a comedy series about his life. In 2011 Johnson appeared in the ring for the first time in seven
                    years, sparking a feud with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) star John Cena that culminated in a main-event match at WrestleMania XXVIII in April 2012. His appearance contributed to the event’s unparalleled success: with more than
                    1.3 million pay-per-view orders and $67 million in global sales, WrestleMania XXVIII was WWE’s top-grossing pay-per-view broadcast. In January 2013 Johnson captured his eighth professional wrestling title, but he surrendered it less
                    than three months later after losing to Cena in another highly publicized bout.
